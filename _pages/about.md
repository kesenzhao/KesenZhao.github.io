Hi, I’m Kesen! Currently a PhD student at the Université de Montréal, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jianyun Nie. Before I embark on my PhD journay, I received my Master degree at the City University of Hong Kong with distinction under the supervision of Dr. Xiangyu Zhao. Even before that, I finished my Bachelor degree at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. My research interests focus on data mining applications, including recommender systems and dynamic graphs.
